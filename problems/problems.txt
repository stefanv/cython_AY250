Please do explore beyond the problems given, and feel free to ask
questions at any time.

From Python to Cython
---------------------

Consider the provided code, ``fractal.py``, that computes pretty pictures.
Optimise it, using Cython and the techniques discussed in the
lecture.  Your Cython code should be able to outperform the NumPy version
(also provided)!

Wrapping C
----------

Implement a function in Cython that computes ``sin(x)`` on each element of a
large floating point array.  Compare the speed of this function to NumPy's
built-in ``sin`` (which, by the way, can also operate on an entire array at a
time).  If it is faster, can you explain why?

L-Systems
---------

Implement an `L-system <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L-system>`__ in Cython.
Try, for example, to build a Sierpinski Triangle or the Dragon Curve.  If you
want, you can first implement it in pure Python, and then add the type
information later.

Hints
`````

 - Use your Cython program to generate coordinates, then simply "connect the
   dots" using ``matplotlib`` (``import matplotlib.pyplot as plt;
   plt.plot(...)``).

 - Cython can accelerate operations on non-numerical types too.  For example,
   if you store your coordinates in a list, you can use::

     cdef list L = []

   For dictionaries, the type is ``dict``.
